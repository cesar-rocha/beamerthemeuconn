# UConn Beamer themes

This is a repo for the development of LaTeX themes and templates for the University of Connecticut, to complement the PowerPoint themes available on the [Brand Standards website](http://brand.uconn.edu/resources/powerpoint-templates/).

## Themes

The first task is to create the following coordinated Beamer themes:

- `beamercolorthemeuconn.sty` (color theme)
- `beamerinnerthemeuconn.sty` (inner theme)
- `beamerouterthemeuconn.sty` (outer theme)
- `beamerthemeuconn.sty` (theme incorporating the above)

While not yet planned, it would be useful to include poster and report templates as well.

## Use

The examples (the `.tex` files) illustrate how to use the themes in LaTeX documents.

## License
